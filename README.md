## Problem
 Instructional Design Skills Assessment
 
Question 1. Course Development and Launch Planning
Context: As an Instructional Designer at Springboard, you’ll design the curriculum for new courses, with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) creating the content. 
 
Your Task: Assume that Springboard has decided to launch another course in our Data Science segment called Deep Learning Career Track, and you are responsible for creating this online offering from scratch. Please make a list of all the questions you would ask in order to begin the curriculum design process.
 
What we’re looking for: A good answer has a fairly comprehensive, clearly presented list of questions, prioritized by what is important to know before beginning the process vs. what you might need to find out along the way. This is a chance to show us your project development skills as well as your understanding of the company and its customers. 
 
Question 2. Instructional Review of Existing Curriculum
Context: Besides launching new courses, you’ll also help ensure that our existing courses are best-in-class. As part of that, you will review existing courses and, in collaboration with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), provide relevant improvements for students and guides for our mentors. 
 
Note:  If the link takes you to the Career page, please click My Learning > Go to Curriculum and navigate to unit 7 Data Wrangling.

What we’re looking for: This question aims to evaluate your instructional design skills and your understanding of adult pedagogy.
